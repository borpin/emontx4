# Overview

The emonTx v4 is the latest generation of OpenEnergyMonitor open source monitoring hardware, redesigned with a focus on higher accuracy, more CT channels, precision voltage sensing and a new microcontroller core. When combined with the new emonVS voltage sensor, the emonBase base-station and a selection of CT sensors, it provides an end-to-end electricity monitoring solution perfect for monitoring home consumption, solar generation, EV charging, heat pumps, battery storage or any AC electrical circuit for that matter.

**Key features:**

- 6x clip-on CT current sensor inputs (suitable for a range of 333mV voltage output CT sensors).
- emonVs precision voltage sensor input.
- Full Real/Active power measurement & continuous sampling.
- Cumulative energy persisted on reboot.
- The initial firmware release supports single phase monitoring only.
- Hardware support for 3 phase voltage sensing (3-phase firmware available 2023).
- 3 pluggable terminal block inputs for DS18B20 temperature sensing, pulse counting or an analogue voltage input.
- RJ45 socket for pulse counting and DS18B20 temperature sensors.
- On-board USB to UART converter for easier programming and serial output.
- 433 MHz radio transceiver
- Extension header pins for use with ESP8266, ESP32, Pi Pico & Pi Zero development board extension modules
- Wall-mount aluminium enclosure
